# Automatic-Potato-Separation-Device
A method to separate potatoes from a mixture of soil and potato harvested from the field. 

# Abstract 
Several methods have been developed in an effort
to improve harvest efficiency and optimize soil separation in
automated potato separation operations. Unfortunately, during
the separation process, several of these procedures cause damage
to the potatoes. Addressing this concern, a novel method is presented using a structure comprising a sieve plate, three brushes,
and two fans.According to research findings, this new method
cleans potatoes more effectively while causing the least amount
of damage. It has been identified through careful simulation that
increasing the sieving plate’s oscillation frequency and the brush
system’s revolutions per minute (rpm) greatly improves system
efficiency as a whole. The careful selection of the number of
brushes used and the oscillating speeds utilized in the system are
important factors in attaining maximum efficiency.This technique
not only shows positive results in reducing potato damage during
separation, but it also highlights the possibility of significant gains
in total process efficiency. The key to optimizing the effectiveness
of this novel potato separation system is the methodical adjustment of operating parameters, such as oscillation frequency and
brush system rpm
